00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,279
30 years ago, all of this was just a disused dockyard.

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,040
You had rusty cranes, empty warehouses.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
Ireland's economy was was really struggling.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,040
There was massive unemployment.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
Young people were leaving in their droves to try and find jobs elsewhere.

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
And then the government decided to take a massive gamble,

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,480
which wasn't uncontroversial at the time.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:37,200
They slashed the corporate tax rates to 12 and a half% which is way lower than you find in other developed countries and it worked.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,039
That tax cut along with a suite of generous incentives turned a few heads among some key global players and soon the multinationals came.

10
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,920
Tech giants, finance firms, all wanting a foothold in Ireland.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,630
And with them came jobs, wealth, and a brand new skyline.

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,990
&gt;&gt; Of course, it helped the island had this young English-speaking, well-educated population.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
This area became known as the Silicon Docks.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,600
And by 2024, Ireland's GDP was among the highest per capita in the world.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,990
Although, like so many things here, there is a twist.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,799
&gt;&gt; Hi.

17
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,149
Can I have Guinness?

18
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,230
This bite here represents Ireland's GDP.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,670
It's nice and full, almost overflowing.

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,600
GDP, however, is slightly distorted by the presence of those big global players.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:43,520
A lot of that money flows out of the country back to the big multinational headquarters.

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,960
And what's left is known as the GNI, which is the gross national income.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,759
Now, this is the bit that stays in the country.

25
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,000
This is often seen as a better measure of Ireland's actual economy,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,709
and it can be down by up to a third,

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,960
&gt;&gt; which means quite a lot of this that I've got to drink.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,360
Bear with me.
